Monopoly Simulator
======
This project was made to test to see what tiles are most commonly landed on in Monopoly. I ran this for 1000 games, with 4 players per game, and each game was 1000 turns. This simulation accounts for rolling doubles and the third double putting the player in jail as well as all Chance and Community Chest cards.

The results from the simulation are as follows.

| Jail                  | 5.71531%        |

We can see that Jail is landed on the most by a lot. This is clearly due to the multiple ways you can end up there ( Rolling 3 doubles, landing on Go To Jail, and both Chance and Community Chest cards having Go To Jails ), therefore this is not surprising. We also see that Illionois is commonly landed on as well as St. Charles Place. These both have Chance cards that take you to them, as does Reading Railroad. The orange tiles are also commonly landed on because of their close proximity to Jail and Chance and Community Chest cards. 

Therefor, it seems that it would be most beneficial in an actual game of Monopoly to build properties on the Orange and Red tiles.
